// Run axe-core over the served page, headlessly, in a jsdom DOM.
//
// This is the WCAG gate. It loads each page into a real DOM implementation and runs
// axe-core's WCAG 2.0/2.1/2.2 A and AA rule sets plus the best-practice set, and exits
// non-zero on any violation. It is not a substitute for a human looking at the page:
// jsdom does no layout and computes no colours, so the rules that depend on rendered
// geometry or on painted pixels cannot fire here. Those are named in README.md under
// "What still needs a person", and colour contrast is measured separately, off the
// palette itself, in tests/test_page.py -- issue #49 is the assistive-technology pass
// no engine can stand in for.
//
// axe returns four buckets, not two: `passes`, `violations`, `inapplicable`, and
// `incomplete`, the rules it ran and could not decide. The obvious gate reads only
// `violations`, prints `ok`, and exits 0 -- and that gate reports a page carrying a
// real problem as clean whenever axe files the problem as undecided rather than as a
// violation. It was measured doing exactly that in the sibling `perimeter`
// repository on 2026-08-18. An undecided rule is not a passing rule, and rendering
// "could not check" as "clean" is the one reading this repository exists to refuse.
//
// So: every undecided rule is named in the output on every run, and an undecided rule
// that has not been declared below, with a reason and with where it is covered instead,
// fails the gate.
//
// This is the floor rather than the whole gate. `make a11y-browser` runs the same
// rule sets in Chromium, where nothing is undecidable, so every rule declared below is
// also decided by something. This run is kept because it needs no browser binary and
// because the two engines disagree in a useful direction: in `perimeter` the browser
// run found a serious 2.1.1 failure the jsdom run could not see, because whether a
// container scrolls depends on layout and jsdom does none. Every wide table on this
// page sits in exactly such a container.
//
// Exit codes:
//   0  every page decided, no violations; the declared-undecidable rules are listed
//   1  a violation, or a rule axe could not decide that is not declared below
//   2  no directory given, or no .html files in it
//
// Usage: node tools/a11y.mjs <directory-of-html-files>
